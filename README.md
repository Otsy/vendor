# Vendor

The Vendor tool copies go dependencies to the `./vendor` directory. 

Vendor is the simplest way to ensure all necessary dependencies are located in one 
place without complicated file management or hidden assumptions. It's all about keeping 
it simple and straightforward.

NOTE: Before using Vendor, be sure the relevant dependencies are already in `GOPATH`. It will **only** copy 
dependencies in your `GOPATH`; it ignores anything outside. 

## Install

	$ go get github.com/bmizerany/vendor

## Use

After you've installed Vendor, it's easy to use.

To vendor all dependencies for a main package:

	$ vendor ./cmd/myapp

To update an already vendored dependency:

	$ vendor github.com/lib/pq

If you have an admin or deploy script with dependencies not in the "main" packages, use:

	$ vendor admin.go

It just works. That's all.

## Motivation

We wanted a simple vendoring tool that stays out of our way and that makes less
assumptions about what we want and don't want in our vendor directory. Instead
vendor makes assumptions about how you use it and what you ask of it. 

##Assumptions
Vendor assumes:

   * Dependencies will be copied to `./vendor`. Vendor assumes you're running it 
    in the parent directory of your vendor folder. If your vendor folder does not 
    exist it will create it for you in the current directory.

   * Dependencies in their working directories are structured in they way you want 
    them to be structured be under `./vendor`. Vendor does not check if there are 
    uncommitted changes in the dependencies' working directory. The check is costly in 
    terms of time and usually gets in the way when you're iterating on one package and 
    vendoring it in another to test or experiment.

   * Dependencies aren't always `import`ed.

    We have a script that uses `go install` to install `vendor/github.com/backplaneio/tools/cmd/bpagent` 
    and runs it for development. Everyone on the team is using the same binary, guaranteed.

   Because this isn't imported, other dependency tools won't allow us to vendor it and keep it 
   up to date. We resorted to using `cp -R` manually on that package and all of its dependencies
   as a short term solution and I made sure this tool could do it.

   * Dependencies that exist in subdirectories of the working directory vendor is run in are 
    to be ignored. Vendor will not vendor anything that is already in the working tree.

   * Dependencies are either not versioned or poorly versioned. Vendor assumes that you would 
    rather manage versions of dependencies yourself.

   * You're using source control. The rollback function for Vendor is `git checkout -f -- vendor`. 
    Vendor isn't careful because it assumes you are and can rollback any mistakes you may make 
    while using vendor. Vendor doesn't make mistakes. :)

## Goals

* Be fast
* Get out of the way
* Do only what is asked of it
